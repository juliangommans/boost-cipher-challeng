# Cipher Code Challenge

A quick challenge to make a program that can use an Atbash cipher to decrypt messages (given the appropriate key)

P.S. There was a slight distraction in between commiting the tests and finishing the challenge as my baby had just thrown up everywhere and I had to go help my wife.
